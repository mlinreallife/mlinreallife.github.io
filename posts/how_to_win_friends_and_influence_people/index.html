    <p>If human relationships are more important than technical methods and tools in our jobs, can I learn something from a book like <em>How to win friends and influence people</em>? This one was published in 1936 and written by Dale Carnegie. It is a self-help book.</p>
<h1 id="many-principles-are-included-in-the-book">Many principles are included in the book</h1>
<p>Dale Carnegie advises about how to handle people, win friends, influence people, and become a leader.</p>
<p>The overall idea is to avoid arguments and criticize people. Instead of that, try to understand them. Make an effort towards them. Encourage them to speak. Be a deep listener. Smile. Show respect. Admit your errors. Never say to someone that he is wrong. Don&rsquo;t lose your temper.</p>
<p>This is what you will find in this book. I found the reading interesting but also terribly disappointing.</p>
<h1 id="why-is-this-reading-interesting">Why is this reading interesting?</h1>
<p>I enjoyed several ideas that were reported.</p>
<ul>
<li>People want to be viewed as important.</li>
</ul>
<p>They want to be recognized. This is the assumption of the book. By helping people to feel important, you help yourself.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Recognize your mistakes. You will be wrong more often than you think. That&rsquo;s not a big deal to recognize it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make people think your idea is theirs
Before, I used to be depressed when an idea I have repeated for months suddenly became the idea of someone else in the team. I was upset that nobody remembered it was MY idea at the beginning. It&rsquo;s an egotistic opinion. More than that, the most important is that the idea is finally considered.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="why-is-this-reading-not-enough">Why is this reading not enough?</h1>
<p>The idea of the book is to avoid conflicts and arguments. You must not complain.
From a psychological point of view, it&rsquo;s hard. It leads to the idea that you must never lose your temper, be sad or angry. You must not fail and stay in a perfectly happy mood. Of course, no one likes arguing or complaining. However, complaints are sometimes important. If you never say that you don&rsquo;t like something in your team and want to improve it, you will never make progress.</p>
<p>More than that, you must not talk and let others express themselves. I think it&rsquo;s important that everyone, including you, expresses oneself.</p>
<p>The second problem I have is when facing sexism, homophobia, or racism in your job. When you&rsquo;re not able to make an impact because of outside facts like that, putting in the shoes of the other person and be kind don&rsquo;t help. Sadly, it happens more often than I would like.</p>
<p>Finally, the book seems a bit manipulative. One chapter is about influencing people without them noticing it.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>If human relationships are more important than technical methods and tools in our jobs, it might be useful to start looking for some new inspirations.
But, I don&rsquo;t know if I would recommend this reading.</p>
