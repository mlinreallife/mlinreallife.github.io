        Machine learning in real life is hard. Finding your way into all the methods and tools is not easy. Here you will find some resources that inspired me recently to do unit tests for data and productionalize models.
Automating Large-Scale Data Quality Verification It&rsquo;s the paper behind Deequ, a library to do unit tests for data. It&rsquo;s very instructive. You will see how the tool was thought. I didn&rsquo;t know that it was possible to profile your data to help you decide the tests you want to launch.

        Unit tests for data? Strange concept maybe. This is why I really wanted to make a video to quickly present that to you.
  I realise there are many things to improve in this first video. I&rsquo;ll improve that over time.
Thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me on Twitter if you want to discuss that.

        I&rsquo;ve recently tested Alibi-detect. If you&rsquo;re looking for a free and open source tool to detect data drift, this one is for you.
Let&rsquo;s get an overview of what is inside and how you can use it.
The assumptions The data drift detection of the library is based on a paper called Failing Loudly: An Empirical Study of Methods for Detecting Dataset Shift and written by Stephan Rabanser, Stephan Günnemann, and Zachary C.

        In a very near world, machine learning was more and more used. All of a sudden, a pandemic stroke this world. Machine learning crashed.
Why does machine learning crash in such a period? Machine learning learns patterns from data at a certain period of time. We evaluate and tune the performance of a predictive system at this certain period of time. But, only the change is permanent.
With Covid-19, the lockdowns, the recession, the curfews, everything has changed.

        Have you ever struggled to explain why automated tests are important (or why refactoring should be a natural step when developing, or anything like that) to very reluctant and dogmatic but influential people such as well-established but very old school architects for instance?
I&rsquo;m sure you already have experienced that and will maybe face other situations like that in the future.
How can we find new arguments to help ourselves or at least have fun in these hard discussions?

        If human relationships are more important than technical methods and tools in our jobs, can I learn something from a book like How to win friends and influence people? This one was published in 1936 and written by Dale Carnegie. It is a self-help book.
Many principles are included in the book Dale Carnegie advises about how to handle people, win friends, influence people, and become a leader.
The overall idea is to avoid arguments and criticize people.

        In some interviews, some people enjoy asking: what was your best failure in your career? I used to hate this question. Failure is just failure, something that should not arrive at any cost. After some readings, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.
Before, I was very afraid of failures. I hated them. As a consequence, I did my best to avoid them. I realised that failures might be more valuable than I thought at the beginning.

        A quick article to explain the difference between two relatively new concepts: MLOps and DataOps.
DataOps  DataOps is an automated, process-oriented methodology, used by analytic and data teams, to improve the quality and reduce the cycle time of data analytics. (Wikipedia)
 What is inside?  Methods from DevOps Deployment of data pipelines such as data extraction and data transformation Monitoring for data pipelines  Target Data teams such as data analytics and data engineering teams.

        Pomodoro might be an overrated technique. And yet, I can&rsquo;t help thinking it might be a good idea to talk about that. I would like to share my point of view and the way I work with this method. Let&rsquo;s go.
What is Pomodoro? Pomodoro is a technique that helps you to stay focus. The steps are:
 Set a timer of 25 minutes. Work until the bell rings. Take a short break (3 to 5 minutes) Repeat  After 4 iterations, take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes).

        Today, I would like to talk about a tough and important subject in my opinion: data drift monitoring.
Data drift monitoring is critical. Data drift leads to model performance decrease. At the same time, IMHO, it&rsquo;s hard to get a satisfactory solution for at least two reasons:
 It&rsquo;s challenging to develop a custom solution. It&rsquo;s laborious to know if it is preferable to compute statistical distances or try to reject a hypothesis test with a p-value?

        I&rsquo;ve recently played with a tool named Streamlit. I wanted to share this experience with you.
If you want to build a simple web page to expose your models using only Python, this library is for you.
Streamlit was launched the first of october in 2019. You can get more information in the launch blog post.
Here is the traditional hello world:
import streamlit as st st.write(&#34;Hello world!&#34;) With that, you get this:
