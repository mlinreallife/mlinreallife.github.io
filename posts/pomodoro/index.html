    <p>Pomodoro might be an overrated technique. And yet, I can&rsquo;t help thinking it might be a good idea to talk about that. I would like to share my point of view and the way I work with this method. Let&rsquo;s go.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-pomodoro">What is Pomodoro?</h1>
<p>Pomodoro is a technique that helps you to stay focus. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set a timer of 25 minutes.</li>
<li>Work until the bell rings.</li>
<li>Take a short break (3 to 5 minutes)</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ol>
<p>After 4 iterations, take a longer break (15 to 30 minutes).</p>
<h1 id="how-does-it-work-for-me">How does it work for me?</h1>
<h2 id="i-define-the-goals-of-the-task-before-starting-it">I define the goals of the task before starting it</h2>
<p>I don&rsquo;t start a task without defining its goals. I write these goals.
I try to choose reasonable objectives to achieve.</p>
<p>If I didn&rsquo;t finish at the end of the iteration, I continue these goals for the next one.
If I finished earlier, I start another task even if I didn&rsquo;t write it.</p>
<p>I enjoy writing the purposes of my next iteration to give me a target to reach. I want it to be a booster, not a blocker. This is why I don&rsquo;t want to make the defined goals an absolute and fixed obligation.</p>
<h2 id="i-accept-multi-tasking-and-declare-it-officially">I accept multi-tasking and declare it officially</h2>
<p>Multi-taking is not always a bad thing. If you mix a brainless task such as running several times a big job with different parameters and another task such as coding, I don&rsquo;t see the problem. More than that, in this case, multi-tasking is helpful.</p>
<p>When I define the goals of my next step, if I plan to make multi-tasking, I write it this way:
Running jobs + coding this</p>
<h2 id="i-accept-interruptions-from-my-coworkers">I accept interruptions from my coworkers</h2>
<p>Many people see Pomodoro as a way to avoid interruptions from colleagues. This is not my goal. As a member of a team that wants to progress together, I don&rsquo;t fear questions from my coworkers. I don&rsquo;t see them as an obstacle. Sometimes, I prefer booking a dedicated meeting to take time thinking about the raised issue. Most of the time, I&rsquo;m open to disconnections.</p>
<p>Once again, the written goals are supposed to be a booster, not a blocker, not an absolute target to reach.</p>
<h2 id="i-use-an-online-tool">I use an online tool</h2>
<p>I used to write my objectives manually and set the timer with my mobile phone.</p>
<p>Now, I prefer using an <a href="https://pomodoro-tracker.com/">online tool</a>.</p>
<h1 id="why-do-i-like-pomodoro">Why do I like Pomodoro?</h1>
<p>Sometimes, when I have to deal with a piece of work, I&rsquo;m fearful. I don&rsquo;t know how to start. I wonder if I will be able to achieve it one day. Do I have the ability to find a solution to this tricky problem? Sometimes, I&rsquo;m so scared that I prefer doing anything else than what I&rsquo;m required to do.</p>
<p>Pomodoro alleviates my anxiety and helps me to stay focus. Yes, I still have to give efforts but it&rsquo;s much easier. I say to me: do your job for 25 minutes, then you&rsquo;re free. After some iterations, things become to be smooth. And very often, at this moment, I stop doing Pomodoro. I don&rsquo;t need it anymore. I&rsquo;m focused on my mission and ready to complete it.</p>
<p>This is why I like this tool.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/saby_nastasia">Twitter</a> if you want to discuss that.</p>
