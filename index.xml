      <title>Data drift monitoring: hypothesis tests or statistical distances?</title>

      <description>Today, I would like to talk about a tough and important subject in my opinion: input data drift monitoring.
Data drift monitoring is critical. Input data drift leads to model performance decrease. At the same time, IMHO, it&amp;rsquo;s hard to get a satisfactory solution for at least two reasons:
 It&amp;rsquo;s challenging to develop a custom solution. It&amp;rsquo;s laborious to know if it is preferable to compute statistical distances or try to reject a hypothesis test with a p-value?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently played with a tool named Streamlit. I wanted to share this experience with you.
If you want to build a simple web page to expose your models using only Python, this library is for you.
Streamlit was launched the first of october in 2019. You can get more information in the launch blog post.
Here is the traditional hello world:
import streamlit as st st.write(&amp;#34;Hello world!&amp;#34;) With that, you get this:</description>

      <title>Different ways to do data versioning</title>

      <description>I have experienced two ways of doing data versioning and would like to share it with you.
It was always in a batch context to do supervised or unsupervised learning.
What is data versioning? Data versioning is about keeping snapshots of the state of your data. This way, you can see the state of the data at certain periods of time.
Why doing data versioning? There are many benefits:
  Rollbacks and replays on a specific date.</description>

      <title>Do data scientists act crazy?</title>
      <link>https://mlinreallife.github.io/posts/data-scientists-crazy/</link>

      <description>I used to be a web developer. The first time, I saw code from a data scientist, I was shocked. For me it was a mess. The quality was poor in comparison of what I was used to doing in software development. There was almost no test. I was unpleasantly surprised to see that sometimes there was no versioning system.
Seeing that, I was sure: data scientists act crazy. Now, I am a data scientist.</description>

      <title>Is meritocracy possible? Is meritocracy acceptable? Answers from the book &#39;The rise of the meritocracy&#39;</title>
      <link>https://mlinreallife.github.io/posts/meritocracy/</link>

      <description>Some times ago, I read a book about Agile. I found this reading inspiring. However, an idea struck me: some teams prefer hierarchy and some others meritocracy.
This is not the first time I see the word meritocracy used in software development or in data science. Sometimes, I also see articles bringing the idea that Agile enhances meritocracy.
But what is meritocracy? Is it something desirable?
Back to the origin Where does this word come fromÂ ?</description>

      <title>Getting started with MLeap and Scikit-Learn</title>
      <link>https://mlinreallife.github.io/posts/mlleap/</link>

      <description>Deploying machine learning data pipelines and algorithms should not be a time-consuming or difficult task. MLeap allows data scientists and engineers to deploy machine learning pipelines from Spark and Scikit-learn to a portable format and execution engine (MLeap documentation).
 MLeap helps you to serialize and deserialize your model/pipeline. It exists for Spark, Scikit-Learn and Tensorflow. You can use it with Scikit-Learn but the documentation is quite dry for the moment.</description>

      <title>How do I test with Apache Spark?</title>
      <link>https://mlinreallife.github.io/posts/spark-tests/</link>

      <description>If you are wondering how you can test with Apache Spark. Or if you are curious about how other projects deal with tests, this article is for you. I will show examples in Scala with Specs2 but the global idea can work with any language or framework test.
What do we need to test with Apache Spark? This is the first problem. Suppose that we have data about diamonds sales. We want to extract only one field (the diamond color) from all the information.</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Nastasia Saby. I&amp;rsquo;m a machine learning engineer. My goal is to give insights of machine learning in real life.
I enjoy sharing inspiring readings and interesting experiences I had.
