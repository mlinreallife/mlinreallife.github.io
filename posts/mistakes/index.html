  <div class="post">
    <p>Most of the time, as data scientists or developers, we speak about our successes. Today, I would like to deal with the mistakes I&rsquo;ve done in my career. Sometimes mistakes can be a valuable share.
I&rsquo;ve chosen four ones.</p>
<h1 id="1-invoices-in-production">1. Invoices in production</h1>
<p>Once, I created invoices in production. I hadn&rsquo;t realised I was working in the production environment and wanted to debug something directly into the application.</p>
<p>Oops. I was livid. What was I gonna do?</p>
<p>To fix that, I removed the invoices created in production directly in the database.</p>
<p><strong>Which lessons can I learn from that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To err is human</li>
<li>Add a graphical option when you&rsquo;re connected to the production like a big warning. You can set this only for the admin users. This way, you have less chance of doing a mistake.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="2-stop-the-source-of-revenue-of-a-company-for-one-full-day">2. Stop the source of revenue of a company for one full day</h1>
<p>Once I did a small pull request. In this one, I removed by error a line of code that was calling the way to count the advertisements that were displayed in the application. I was working in a company whose revenues were generated by advertisements.</p>
<p>Two people reviewed my pull request but didn&rsquo;t notice I had removed the line that was calling the micro-service in charge of counting the advertisements. The tests were okay.</p>
<p><strong>Which lessons can I learn from that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>To err can be collectively human.</li>
<li>Micro-services work. The application was not down. Only the advertisements counter was down.</li>
<li>Test when you call a micro-service if you have called it in your unit tests. Some libraries such as Atoum in PHP can help with that. You mock your micro-service and check that it is called.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="3-believing-that-100-of-code-coverage-and-a-green-sonar-are-enough">3. Believing that 100% of code coverage and a green Sonar are enough</h1>
<p>I&rsquo;ve talked about two technical problems. For me, the worst mistakes are when you are intellectually wrong.</p>
<p>One of my biggest error was that at the beginning of my career, I did tests, but it was really bad tests. I was developing with PHP and my tests were doing the role of a compilator, no more. I hadn&rsquo;t realised yet that the purposes of tests are much more than that.</p>
<p>As we had almost 90% of code coverage and a green Sonar, it was difficult for me to understand the problem. Then, I was sure that if unit tests didn&rsquo;t work, we needed to do functional tests.</p>
<p>I spent a lot of time writing functional tests. These one, as any functional tests, were slow and hard to maintain.</p>
<p>As a result, the team didn&rsquo;t launch them.</p>
<p><strong>Which lessons can I learn from that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>100% of code coverage and a green Sonar are far from enough to get a code free of bugs.</li>
<li>Unit tests are great if you understand that you should use them to test the functionalities of your application.</li>
<li>Use, or at least test, Test Driven Development and/or a mutation testing tool to understand better what a good test is.</li>
<li>Be careful with functional tests. Use them the proper way.</li>
<li>Ask for advice from others when you have a problem.</li>
<li>Never be too sure to get the solution to a problem.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="4-feeling-irritated-about-interruptions-and-questions">4. Feeling irritated about interruptions and questions</h1>
<p>Far from all, I consider that the worst error in my career was to be reluctant to interruptions and questions from my colleagues.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t consider my team. I didn&rsquo;t consider that the work done by my team was also my work.
I didn&rsquo;t notice that their work helped me as mine helped us. I was selfish and blind. As a consequence, I disliked being interrupted. I was irritated when someone asked me a question. I was even more irritated when she or he asked me about something I&rsquo;ve already answered. I&rsquo;m full of regrets when I think of that. How could I be so egoistic and ignorant? After some time, I realised I was wrong. After this experience, I never did that again. Now, I try to show everyone that I&rsquo;m happy to help and I AM. I think it&rsquo;s worthwhile to work as a team.</p>
<p><strong>Which lessons can I learn from that?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>If you work in a team, behave as a member of the team contributing to a collective work.</li>
<li>If you can&rsquo;t stand to work with others, find a job where you can be alone.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of questions and interruptions. They make you progress too.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>I guess every developer or data scientist has already done mistakes. A bug or a bad manipulation can be critical, but its impacts are limited. When you&rsquo;re wrong in your overall assumptions, that can be much more harmful.</p>
