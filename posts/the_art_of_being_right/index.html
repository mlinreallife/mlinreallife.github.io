    <p><strong>Have you ever struggled to explain why automated tests are important (or why refactoring should be a natural step when developing, or anything like that) to very reluctant and dogmatic but influential people such as well-established but very old school architects for instance?</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you already have experienced that and will maybe face other situations like that in the future.</p>
<p>How can we find new arguments to help ourselves or at least have fun in these hard discussions?</p>
<p>An answer can come from a funny book written by a funny man: <em>The art of being right</em> by Arthur Schopenhauer. The German philosopher offers 38 ways to win an argument. I suggest going into 8 ones and use them to defend our position: the importance of automated tests for instance.</p>
<h1 id="1-generalize-the-matter-then-argue-against-it">1. Generalize the Matter, Then Argue Against it</h1>
<p>You can say something like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say there&rsquo;s no need for validation or checks. Then, we will have no idea what we have in production. Ok, let&rsquo;s go to the bugs party.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>or like that:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You say we don&rsquo;t have time to test, then we don&rsquo;t have time to make our job and to build the project. Ok, let&rsquo;s throw it away.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="2-appeal-to-authority-rather-than-reason">2. Appeal to Authority Rather Than Reason</h1>
<p>You can name Kent Beck or some famous developers but be very careful with that. Your opponent might have no idea who these people are.</p>
<p>You can name a big company that makes a lot of money like Google, but your opponent can answer that you&rsquo;re not Google and don&rsquo;t have the same needs.</p>
<p>A better way to appeal to authority is to uses statistics.</p>
<h1 id="3-put-his-thesis-into-some-odious-category">3. Put His Thesis into Some Odious Category</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Only unprofessional people and beginners don&rsquo;t test. This is not what we are.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="4-choose-metaphors-favourable-to-your-proposition">4. Choose Metaphors Favourable to Your Proposition</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>Tests are smooth, beautiful, and crucial. They are the spine of the product. Without them, all will collapse.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="5-arguments-ad-hominem">5. Arguments Ad Hominem</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe that someone of your intelligence and pragmatism is not able to see the importance of automated tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="6-persuade-the-audience-not-the-opponent">6 Persuade the Audience, Not the Opponent</h1>
<p>If your colleagues agree with you, your opponent will feel weak.</p>
<h1 id="7-interrupt-break-divert-the-dispute">7. Interrupt, Break, Divert the Dispute</h1>
<p>Finally, it may be not his role to give his opinion on that. Then find a way to avoid this discussion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I have something much more important to discuss with you. There&rsquo;s a weird bug in production.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="8-claim-victory-despite-defeat">8. Claim Victory Despite Defeat</h1>
<p>Pretend you don&rsquo;t understand the conclusion if it&rsquo;s a defeat. Thank your opponent:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I&rsquo;m happy we finally agreed on the importance of automated tests.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Some arguments are absurd, aren&rsquo;t they? Arthur Schopenhauer thought life was absurd. These 8 ways of winning might seem illogical or manipulative. I see them as entertaining.</p>
<p>I sometimes wonder: why would the great Schopenhauer answer if he was in my place? It can be inspiring. Most of the time, it is at least funny.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend you to read <em>The art of being right</em>. It&rsquo;s delightful.</p>
<p>Thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/saby_nastasia">Twitter</a> if you want to discuss that.</p>
