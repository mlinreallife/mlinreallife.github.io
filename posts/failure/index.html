    <p>In some interviews, some people enjoy asking: what was your best failure in your career? I used to hate this question. Failure is just failure, something that should not arrive at any cost. After some readings, I&rsquo;ve changed my mind.</p>
<p>Before, I was very afraid of failures. I hated them. As a consequence, I did my best to avoid them. I realised that failures might be more valuable than I thought at the beginning.</p>
<p>What I define here as a failure is a wrong road, a path you took and conducted you nowhere or to a bad solution.</p>
<h1 id="first-enlightenment-you-will-face-failures">First enlightenment: you will face failures</h1>
<p>First of all, something simple but with large consequences: you will face failures. I&rsquo;m not saying that you cannot avoid some of them. But for sure, you will face failures.</p>
<h1 id="second-enlightenment-its-not-because-you-get-once-a-failure-that-you-could-be-able-to-avoid-the-same-one-next-time">Second enlightenment: It&rsquo;s not because you get once a failure that you could be able to avoid the same one next time</h1>
<p>If failures could be a way of learning, learning takes time.</p>
<p>To explain that, I would like to share with you the content of my first reading. It&rsquo;s a poem from Portia Nelson that is valuable in my opinion.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I</p>
<p>I walk down the street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk</p>
<p>I fall in.</p>
<p>I am lost &hellip; I am helpless.</p>
<p>It isn&rsquo;t my fault.</p>
<p>It takes me forever to find a way out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>II</p>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I pretend I don&rsquo;t see it.</p>
<p>I fall in again.</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t believe I am in the same place</p>
<p>but, it isn&rsquo;t my fault.</p>
<p>It still takes a long time to get out.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>III</p>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I see it is there.</p>
<p>I still fall in &hellip; it&rsquo;s a habit.</p>
<p>my eyes are open</p>
<p>I know where I am.</p>
<p>It is my fault.</p>
<p>I get out immediately.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>IV</p>
<p>I walk down the same street.</p>
<p>There is a deep hole in the sidewalk.</p>
<p>I walk around it.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>V</p>
<p>I walk down another street.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="third-enlightenment-without-post-mortem-failure-is-just-unworthwhile-failure">Third enlightenment: without post-mortem, failure is just unworthwhile failure</h1>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t realise you have failed and don&rsquo;t try to understand why, failure has no chance to give you any insight. In this case, I still think failure is just unworthwhile failure.</p>
<p>John Lunney and Sue Lueder write an article entitled <a href="https://landing.google.com/sre/sre-book/chapters/postmortem-culture/">Postmortem Culture: Learning from Failure</a> where they deal with this postmortem culture in their job.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The cost of failure is education.
(Devin Carraway)</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="fourth-enlightenment-you-will-fail-then-fail-fast">Fourth enlightenment: You will fail. Then, fail fast.</h1>
<p>Don&rsquo;t stay stick to sunk costs.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not because you&rsquo;ve spent XXXXXX euros on a solution that doesn&rsquo;t work that you need to spend more money. Save your money and time for another solution.</p>
<h1 id="fifth-enlightenment-dont-be-afraid-to-look-like-an-idiot-expect-and-accept-failures">Fifth enlightenment: Don&rsquo;t be afraid to look like an idiot. Expect and accept failures.</h1>
<p>Failures still make me feel uncomfortable. I feel stupid when I face one. But if I&rsquo;m able to change my view about failures and myself, I can go higher.</p>
<p>John Sonmez says in his article entitled <a href="https://simpleprogrammer.com/don/">Don’t Be Afraid To Look Like An Idiot</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>being afraid of looking like an idiot can really hold you back and prevent you from growing in your career and in your life</p>
</blockquote>
<p>More than that, I think it can hold you back from a good solution to your problem.</p>
<p>Expect and accept failures. If you need to find a solution to a problem, the first one might not be the better one. And that&rsquo;s pretty normal.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>You can take some insights from failures if you&rsquo;re not afraid of them and take time to understand them. In any case, you cannot avoid failures. Then, it&rsquo;s better to expect and accept them. Keep making reasonable choices based on arguments, but don&rsquo;t be surprised if your assumption reveals itself wrong.</p>
<p>Here is my opinion after some uplifting readings:</p>
