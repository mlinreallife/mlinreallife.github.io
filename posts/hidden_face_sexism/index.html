    <p>Have you ever been discriminated against? I have. Have you ever been discriminated against without being sure of that? I have.</p>
<p>TL;DR: People don&rsquo;t always directly insult you because you&rsquo;re a woman. They just don&rsquo;t consider you. It&rsquo;s harmful and must be taken into consideration to improve our jobs and lives.</p>
<h1 id="sexism-is-vicious-because-it-doesnt-always-tell-its-name">Sexism is vicious because it doesn&rsquo;t always tell its name</h1>
<p>Once, I had a colleague, a man. We were intellectually and technically on the same page. And yet, there were frictions between us. My opinion was not always valued. I found the situation weird. I wasn&rsquo;t able to understand the problem.</p>
<p>Some months after, this colleague apologised saying that he had been rude to me because I was a woman and had realised it was wrong behaviour. I finally got the key to our bad relations.</p>
<p>The problem is that sexist people don&rsquo;t often claim aloud: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a sexist person. I won&rsquo;t consider you because you&rsquo;re a woman&rdquo;.</p>
<p>In reality, I have experienced other situations when people openly explain that they don&rsquo;t want to work with you because you&rsquo;re a woman. I hate saying that but the truth is that it&rsquo;s easier to deal with these situations than to deal with unspoken or even unconscious sexism.</p>
<p><strong>The problem is that sexist people are not always able to realise they are. Misogyny is so unconscious and deeply rooted in our societies</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="misogyny-happens-more-often-than-you-think">Misogyny happens more often than you think</h1>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, I have worked with superb colleagues that respected me. I&rsquo;ve also experienced conflicts with people because we were just not on the same page.</p>
<p>But too often, I can&rsquo;t help noticing that my opinion or the opinion of another woman is not valued whereas the same opinion coming from a man seems so important.</p>
<p>In these kinds of situations, I can only have suspicions. If you express your suspicions, you take the risk of being seen as someone who pretends to be the victim. Then, you paradoxically become the persecutor.</p>
<p>What can you do in this case?</p>
<p>I have no idea ðŸ˜Ÿ.</p>
<p>In a more general way, I would advise this though:</p>
<ul>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to explain your opinion. It&rsquo;s always worthwhile to express an opinion.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid of repeating an idea. You might not be heard the first or second time you express it.</li>
<li>Don&rsquo;t be afraid to look like an idiot. Ridicule never killed anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you for reading. Feel free to contact me on <a href="https://twitter.com/saby_nastasia">Twitter</a> if you want to discuss that and/or would like to provide advice on this important topic.</p>
